#+TITLE: OrgPublish

This repo builds a docker image to publish org files to html. This docker image
is built off of alpine:latest to keep it as small and minimal as possible.

* Running
  To run this docker image to publish your org-mode files to html simply run the
  command:

  ~docker run -v <org directory>:/opt/OrgFiles maker2413/OrgPublish~

* Configuring
  This docker iamge has a publish.el file that I put together to do a basic
  publish of org files to html. This publish function can be overwritten by
  passing a custom publish.el in via the ~-v~ flag. The entrypoint for this
  docker image uses ~/opt/publish.el~ for the publish function.
